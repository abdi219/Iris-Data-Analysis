# Iris Species Classification using Logistic Regression

This project demonstrates a basic machine learning workflow using the Iris dataset. The model is implemented in Python using scikit-learn within a Jupyter Notebook environment.

## Project Overview

The following steps were performed:

- Loading the dataset from a CSV file  
- Preprocessing the data by separating features and labels  
- Training a Logistic Regression model  
- Making predictions using the trained model  

## Technologies Used

- Python  
- pandas  
- scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## Dataset

The dataset contains measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three species of iris flowers.
